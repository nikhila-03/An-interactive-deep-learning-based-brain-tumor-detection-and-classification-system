1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset 
	- Stage 1 - Two Class Brain Tumor
	- Stage 2 - Four Class Brain Tumor
3. Image processing
	- using ImageDataGenerator 
		- Re-scaling the Image
		- Shear Transformation
		- Zooming the Image
		- Horizontal Flip 
		- Reshaping the Image 
	
4. Building the model 

	Stage 1 and Stage 2 Dataset
        - CNN
        - Xception
        - ResNet
	- DenseNet201

5. Training the model
6. Building the model 




Flask Framework
----------------

 
7. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
8. Importing the packages
9. User Select the option of stage (1 or 2)
10. Based on the selection the form image open for image upload
11. User Upload an image for analysis
12. The given input is preprocessed 
13. The trained model is used for predicting the result
14. Final Outcome is display 

Extension
----------

In the base paper, the author mentioned to use different models for analysis the Brain Tumor dataset with CNN, got 88% of accuracy, 
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other techniques such as ResNet, DenseNet and Xception for Classification 
from which Xception got 99 and 99% of accuracy for Both the dataset respectively ,
With the above As an extension we can build the front end using flask framework for user testing with authentication.
